Add version information.

Modify the main menu.

Fix Score list bug...

Fix stylus control issue.

Remove efsroot from subversion control. (because of the bad compatibility)


PS: There was a v0.4 in my subversion, but I never release it.

----
*v0.3*
Add Stylus control, now you can play with pad and stylus.

Modify the game initial, the sum of bullet add 1 every 5 seconds.

Becase of googlecode's role, that when a file first made download available to users, it became part of the history of the project, I can't delete or modify the old file anymore.

So~ From v0.3 the new version will be released with the filename as "TKKN_vx.x.nds".

Fix out of memory issue.
